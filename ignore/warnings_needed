warnings

lens_search and lens count need a warning where the search query is greater than length 1 but boolean is not selected. Maybe set the default in these cases to OR as that is what will be needed most of the time.

test <- lens_count(synbio, type = "tac") produces the following.  Error: expecting a single value

It should be test <- lens_count(synbio, boolean = "OR", type = "tac")
